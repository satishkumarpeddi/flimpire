Flimpire 🎬

A responsive frontend clone / UI demo inspired by Netflix — built with modern web tooling.

This project replicates a simplified version of Netflix's user interface. It focuses on the layout, movie cards, navigation, responsiveness, and styling. It is frontend-only (no backend in this repo) and is a good base or reference for building similar streaming/demo sites.
